Hi! I'm Marielle, I go by Ayel too. I‚Äôm passionate about tech, teaching, and continuous learning.

What I‚Äôm Currently Exploring:
- Improving my teaching methodologies for IT-related subjects
- Deepening my expertise in web systems and technologies
- Developing projects that bridge theory and innovation

I enjoy wearing different hats; whether as a leader, follower, or strategist‚Äîand I always find ways to bring creativity into everything I do. I‚Äôm still shaping the kind of professional and educator I want to become, and I believe every experience and person I meet adds value to that journey.
